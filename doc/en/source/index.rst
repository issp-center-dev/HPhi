About :math:`{\mathcal H}\Phi`
---------------------------------
A numerical solver package for a wide range of quantum lattice models including Hubbard-type itinerant electron hamiltonians, quantum spin models, and Kondo-type hamiltonians for itinerant electrons coupled with quantum spins. The Lanczos algorithm for finding ground states and newly developed Lanczos-based algorithm for finite-temperature properties of these models are implemented for parallel computing. A broad spectrum of users including experimental researchers is cordially welcome.
