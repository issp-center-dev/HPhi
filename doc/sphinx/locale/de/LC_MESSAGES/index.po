"A numerical solver package for a wide range of quantum lattice models "
"including Hubbard-type itinerant electron hamiltonians, quantum spin "
"models, and Kondo-type hamiltonians for itinerant electrons coupled with "
"quantum spins. The Lanczos algorithm for finding ground states and newly "
"developed Lanczos-based algorithm for finite-temperature properties of "
"these models are implemented for parallel computing. A broad spectrum of "
"users including experimental researchers is cordially welcome."
