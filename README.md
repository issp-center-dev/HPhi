HΦ
====

A numerical solver package for a wide range of quantum lattice models including Hubbard-type itinerant electron hamiltonians, quantum spin models, and Kondo-type hamiltonians for itinerant electrons coupled with quantum spins. The Lanczos algorithm for finding ground states and newly developed Lanczos-based algorithm for finite-temperature properties of these models are implemented for parallel computing. A broad spectrum of users including experimental researchers is cordially welcome.

### Methods
Lanczos algorithm, thermal pure quantum state, full diagonalization  

### Target models
Hubbard model, Heisenberg model, Kondo lattice model, Kitaev model, Kitaev-Heisenberg model, multi-orbital Hubbard model

### Available physical quantities
specific heat, susceptibility, ground state energy, free energy, structure factors


## Requirement
C compiler (intel, Fujitsu, GNU, etc. )  
LAPACK library (intel MKL, Fujitsu, ATLAS, etc.)  
MPI library (If you do not use MPI, it is not necessary.)
